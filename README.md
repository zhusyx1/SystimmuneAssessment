CREATE TABLE Car (

Part III

I have chosen CSV as the encoding format for my data, because CSV files are plain-text files, itâ€™s easier for developers to import into/from spreadsheet and database. And CSV can easily organize large amounts of data.

Instructions of run the program:
-	Python 3.8 was used in the program.
-	Anaconda was used (pandas)
-	In terminal, run python carDealer.py --input_csv_name car.csv
-	Expected outcome: top.html and sales.html will be created in the same directory with one table in each file.
